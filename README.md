# React Coding Exercise

This is the React coding exercise, it's a basic Create React App template with an edited `App.tsx` file. Inside the file
you will find a `mockApi` and an empty React component, the exercise involves using `mockApi` to fetch some data then 
manipulating and displaying the data. There are TypeScript type definitions that you may find useful in `typings.d.ts`.

There are several tasks written in a comment at the top of `App.tsx`, the assignment is to complete these tasks as you
would if it was a real work task. Don't worry about styling everything perfectly, this is primarily a React
and TS/JS task.

We would prefer the tasks be completed using React hooks, if you haven't used them before feel free to take some extra time
to try them out and get used to the concept. There's a good introduction on the [React docs website](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

The task should be completed within an hour. If you haven't made it through all tasks in that time don't worry, just
submit what you have so far. We are more interested in seeing quality code than lots of rushed code.

Once you have completed the exercise, push your code to the forked repo on Github and email the link back to us so
we can take a look.

Good luck!

### Getting Started

1. Fork this repo on Github, see [forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository)
2. Clone to repo to your machine, see [cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository)
3. Open the project in the editor you're most comfortable with
4. Install dependencies: `$ yarn`
5. Run the project locally: `$ yarn start`
    * This will open a browser tab and run the app on `localhost:3000`, the page will update when you make code changes
